The first level of the game (the Cemetery) is "won" by defeating all enemies with the sword obtained further in the level in order to gain a key, then moving towards the gate at the far right to proceed to the Mausoleum.

The Mausoleum level is won by collecting keys, defeating enemies, and moving towards the far right of the level.

The Boss level is won by simply dealing enough damage to the boss to kill it (15 pistol shots or 5 sword swings). Obtaining the pistol in the Mausoleum level is optional but will make the fight much easier.
